Case 2: Representation Structure Analysis Outputs
This directory contains the output files generated by Case 2 experiments, which analyze changes in local and global representation structures before and after sparse encoding.
Files

residual_cache.pkl: Pickle file containing residual representations for each concept and model.
clustering_analysis_results.csv: CSV file with clustering and geometric analysis results (e.g., number of clusters, intrinsic dimensions, MST weights).
clusters_<model>_<concept>_resid.npy: Numpy arrays containing clustering labels for residual stream representations.
clusters_<model>_<concept>_latents.npy: Numpy arrays containing clustering labels for latent representations.
resid_<model>_<concept>.pt: PyTorch tensor files containing residual representations for specific model-concept pairs.
