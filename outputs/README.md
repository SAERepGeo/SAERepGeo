Outputs Directory
This directory contains the results and caches generated by the experiments in the SAERepGeo project. The outputs are organized into three subdirectories, each corresponding to one of the experimental cases described in the paper "Sparsification and Reconstruction from the Perspective of Representation Geometry."
Subdirectories

case1_stratified_manifold/: Contains caches for Case 1 (Stratified Manifold Analysis).
case2_representation_structure/: Contains caches, clustering results, and numpy arrays for Case 2 (Representation Structure Analysis).
case3_intervention_analysis/: Contains results for Case 3 (Intervention Analysis).

Each subdirectory includes a README.md file with detailed descriptions of the files within.
